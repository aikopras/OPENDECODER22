// history:   2007-08-03 V0.1 kw start
//            2011-01-15 V0.2 ap New CV have been added: CmdStation. 
//                               Note that "reserved CVs" have been (mis)used for this purpose
//                               CmdStation is included to correct "errors" made by LENZ LZV100
//                               master stations. Although this correction will not be needed if 
//                               the decoder is used in the traditional way (controlling four 
//                               switches via four subsequent addresses, no RS-bus feedback), it 
//                               will improve operation if it is used together with 
//                               LENZ LZV100 master stations.
//            2012-01-03 v0.3 ap New Cvs for GBM added. 
//            2012-12-27 v0.4 ap Cvs have been reorded and cleaned up, to better support PoM.
//            2013-03-12 v0.5 ap The ability is added to program the CVs on the main (PoM).
//            2014-01-06 v0.6 ap SendFB and AlwaysAct added
